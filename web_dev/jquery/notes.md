study steps 
find cheat sheet /most helpful styntactic methods
find docuentation for jquery
watch an intro video or look at code academy/codewars
find and highlight/bookmark what seems to be the most useful 


link to reference jquery commands https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.min.js
The most helpful startegy here for me was findig a good tutorial video explaining the basic of jquery and showing a few basic tips
