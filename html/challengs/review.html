<h1>Airnav Penn Valley</h1>
<p>This website <a href="view-source:http://www.airnav.com/airport/kseg">Penn Valley airport</a> isn’t necessarily bad but upon examining the page there are some changes I think it could make. On this page I recognize most of the html and I think this reflects it is a rather simple page. This page uses a ton of list and tables to display the navigational data for air craft. Other than maybe some inconsistency with the size of fonts and the dead space on the page I think it does  an effective job with what it tries to accomplish. Some things that it lacks are possible some Block-link elements to help organization because how it is, it is unorganized. </p>

<h1>http://magic.wizards.com/</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://magic.wizards.com/">MTG.com</a> is also a pretty straight forward page . Upon inspection I think the page serves is purpose as a portal to the rest of the site. And when examining code there is definitely some code I don’t fully understand. I think some of the code I see that I don’t understand is CSS and affects the properties of text and images on the screen. There are methods and classes on this page something I have not yet used in HTMl. I also see Block-line elements used more frequently in this  and it think it makes this site better than the previously discussed Airnav on because it is more organized and get a user to its destination effectively.</p>
