<!--
-HTML5 semantic tags are to describe its meaning to the browser and the developer. For me I find the section tag the most useful. Being able to section of area of a page is very helpful for me organizationally.
-The elements on the page will display from top to bottom.
-Sublime and Snippets are a very useful tool if you take the time to invest in making them I also fond some plugins make typing out html much more streamlined. Being able to create snippets will help when I need something like a nav page or a contact page in the future rather than retyping every element every time, so I will definitely use more.
The most difficult part of this challenge was determining whether the content we put in our tags was appropriate. Itâ€™s not like other coding language where improper input may cause an error most tags take in anything you give them so optimization was the biggest issue. I think practicing and looking at established pages will help drive the concept of these tags home for me.
