# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Developers use version control to make it simpler to manage software with multple version.Version control can also help multiple developers to work on a project to keep it more organized. It is useful because  all the changes can be easily tracked and managed while working on a project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
is a separate “wing” of a repository that can be edited often to allow creating of new feature for a “main branch”. You would use this so you can work independently on code and eventually merge it back into a master branch to implement changes/features.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit it when you fianalize and record the changes on a branch of a repository. A good message is something descriptive concise that allows for good organization during development,
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when multiple branches have  changed the same part of a file.This presents itself when one tries to merge a branch to a master or feature branch.
